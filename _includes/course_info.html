                                <p>Predictive modeling is a pillar of modern data science. In this field, scikit-learn is a central tool: it is easily accessible, yet powerful, and naturally dovetails in the wider ecosystem of data-science tools based on the Python programming language.

This course is an in-depth introduction to predictive modeling with scikit-learn. Step-by-step and didactic lessons introduce the fundamental methodological and software tools of machine learning, and is as such a stepping stone to more advanced challenges in artificial intelligence, text mining, or data science.

The course is more than a cookbook: it will teach you to be critical about each step of the design of a predictive modeling pipeline: from choices in data preprocessing, to choosing models, gaining insights on their failure modes and interpreting their predictions.

The training will be essentially practical, focusing on examples of applications with code executed by the participants.

The Mooc is completely free of charge. All the course materials are also available on a github repository.

The authors of the course are scikit-learn core developpers, they will be your guides throughout the training!</p>
