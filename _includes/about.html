            <p>Machine learning is everywhere. It can be used to predict the weather, monitor stock prices, drive autonomous vehicles, and generate art. But deep down, machine learning is all about math, statistics, and code.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In this open online course, we will tell the story of machine learning. We will cover its mathematical and algorithmic foundations and also show how to implement machine learning algorithms in practice.
                We are thrilled that you are here! Welcome to Cornell Techâ€™s CS 5785 - Applied Machine Learning.</p>
